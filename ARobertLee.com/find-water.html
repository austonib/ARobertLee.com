                <h1>How To Find Water</h1>
                  <p>Water is something that you do not want to be without for very long. Dehydration is real and it is not fun. Dehydration causes at its least harmful fatigue, foggy memory, and irritability. At its most harmful, dehydration can kill you. Just use these tips to get at least 2 to 3 quarts of water per day especially if you are not eating as much as you normally would eat.</p>
                  <h2>Never Drink</h2>
                    <p>If you are surviving and dehydrated, you might start thinking some funny things and be tempted to do some even funnier things. Remember NEVER to drink any of the following, no matter how desperate you get.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Urine</li>
                      <li>Blood</li>
                      <li>Juices from fish or other animal</li>
                      <li>Alcohol</li>
                      <li>Sea or salt water</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h2>Ground Water</h2>
                    <p>Keep an eye out for low spots that have especially green trees or plants or muddy areas. You can try digging down about a foot deep and about a foot wide and wait a couple minutes. The hole may fill with water that you can strain through a T-shirt or other cloth. Keep in mind that this is not filtered so it's not completely safe but it will get you by in a pinch.</p>
                  <h2>Purify</h2>
                    <p>Boiling water is the easiest way to purify the water you find in a river or lake. 10 boiling minutes is enough to safely drink any water that you have. You can use plastic containers for boiling but since you have to get all the air out of the bottle to keep it from melting or suspend it above your fire somehow, it's much easier to use a large shell, tin can, or other metal container. You can even drop hot rocks from the fire into these containers to heat the water. Often times, containers for boiling water can be found or made.</p>

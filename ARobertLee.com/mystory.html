                <h1>My Story </h1>
                  <p>How did I get involved with surviving in the wild? Well there have been many influences. I'll explain some here.</p>
                  <h2>B.S.A.</h2>
                    <p>I was involved with the <a href="http://www.scouting.org"> Boy Scouts of America</a> starting at the age of 8. I loved going hiking and camping, tying knots, learning how to make fire, and how to build a shelter. I always enjoyed my time with the Boy Scouts and learned some very valuable life lessons that still help me today.</p>
                  <h2>TV Shows</h2>
                    <p>I love survival shows! There are so many good ones. My favorite is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorman">Survivorman</a> featuring Les Stroud. This guy is the real deal. He survives completely alone for up to ten days in remote locations with little to no food or water upon arrival. While he is all alone, he must perform all of the camera work and recording himself as well.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>You can't mention survival shows without mentioning <a href="http://www.beargrylls.com">Bear Grylls</a>. This guy is insane. He reminds me of myself as a little kid running around my grandparents forested backyard jumping off of rocks and climbing trees. While he seems to do everything at 100 miles per hour, he has some great tips that can help any survivor.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Sometimes you will be surviving with someone else and that's why I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Woman,_Wild">Man, Woman, Wild</a>. Mykel Hawk and Ruth England survive together as husband and wife. Their dynamic relationship shows just how interesting survival can be with two people.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Watching these shows is great entertainment and also provides you with useful information and facts that will pop into your head if you ever need to really use them.</p>
                    <p>Survival in the wild is more to me than just a set of great skills to have to be prepared for the worst. It's fun! There's nothing more empowering than being able to use your surrounding to create the bare necessities. I hope that you will share this outlook after visiting my page.</p>

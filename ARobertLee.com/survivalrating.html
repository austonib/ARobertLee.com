                <h1>What's YOUR Survival Rating?</h1>
                  <p>There are many resources online that can help you determine how prepared you are to survive in the wild. This site is not meant to provide one of those tests or quizzes but rather to explain how they should be used and how they should not be used.</p>
                  <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p>There is no substitute for real world experience. This is important to remember when you spend some time on this site, go take a survival quiz, and ace it. You can't think that this is enough and you can sit back and relax until you find yourself actually in a survival situation. You have to go out into nature and start a fire, build a shelter, and find food and water. Each adventure you go on will bring you closer to being a <a href="beanexpert.html">Survival Expert</a>.</p>

                  <h2>Pointers</h2>
                    <p>One thing these tests and quizzes are really good for is pointers. The questions on these tests will get you thinking about where your priorities need to be when surviving in the wild. Do you think about food or water or a shelter first? You're so thirsty and you stumble upon a flowing stream. What do you do? These are the kinds of things you need to think about BEFORE you are actually in the situation. Open up your favorite search engine and type in "Survival Rating" to find some 15 to 20 question quizzes that are pretty fun.</p>

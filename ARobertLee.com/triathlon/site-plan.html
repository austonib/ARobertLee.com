                  <h2>Site Map:</h2>
                    <img src="media/site-map.png">
                  <h2>Color Scheme:</h2>
                    <img id="color-pic" src="media/color-scheme.png">
                    <p>This is challenging to me because I don’t really know how to show the look and “feel” of prison…while showing the beauty and wonder of the bay area. I would like to use the darker colors for the navigational bar and have the lighter hues be for links.  (the light yellow or the light blue). Links will be one of the lighter blue colors. accents and logos can be some of the yellow. I want to use lighter grey colors as well. I am colorblind so I have to rely a lot of pallet generators and feedback from others.</p>
                  <h2>Typography:</h2>
                    <p id="tahoma">Tahoma for Headings</p>
                    <p>This font called “Tahoma” would be great for headings because its has a heavier weight and will let users see important information quickly.</p>
                    <p id="menlo">Menlo for links</p>
                    <p>This font called “Menlo” would be great for links because it would look good in a deep blue color and underlined </p>
                    <p id="lucida">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut vitae dui consectetur, sollicitudin lacus ac, pellentesque orci. Pellentesque finibus placerat.</p>
                    <p>This font called Lucida would be good for body paragraphs and the bulk of text on the site because it looks clean and easy to read.</p>
                  <h2>navigation:</h2>
                    <p>I want my navigation to be a bar along the top of every page that has all the three main links (Route, Registration, and Contact). A mobile design would have the navbar along the side.</p>

                <h1>How To Build A Shelter</h1>
                  <p>Remember you want to start building your shelter first thing when you discover that you are in a survival situation. You only have limited sunlight to gather supplies from your surroundings. Building most shelters will require a lot of physical exertion so that is another good reason to start early.</p>
                  <h2>Natural Shelter</h2>
                    <p>The easiest type of shelter is a naturally occurring shelter. This could be an opening in a rock face or cave. It could be a large tree that provides shade from the sun or cover from the rain. You would be amazed at how Mother Nature can take care of you if you know what to look for.</p>
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you opt for a cave or rock overhang of any kind, make sure you check the area for animals that could be harmful and any cracks or chance of structural weakness in the rocks above you.</p>
                  <h2>Make A Shelter</h2>
                    <p>Making a shelter yourself is easier than you might think. It will require physical work but the designs are not difficult. The simplest shelter is a debri hut. Find or cut yourself one large and sturdy log or branch that you can lean against a boulder or tree stump so that one end is lifted up off the ground. Scavenge for other branches and sticks that you can lean along the sides of the  big main log. Cover the entire thing in different debris.</p>
                    <div class="divCenter">
                    <img src="media/hut.png" alt="debris hut" height="300px">
                    </div>
                    <p>Whether you choose a natural shelter or make your own shelter, make sure you build your fire near you (without burning down your hut of course), have plenty of fuel for that fire set aside, and you will make it through the night.</p>

                <h1>Site Plan</h1>
                <h3>Site Name</h3>
                  <p>How to Survive in the Wild (<a href="http://www.arobertlee.com">ARobertLee.com</a>)</p>

                <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
                  <p>I have an idea for a website that’s meant for the inner survivor in all of us that knows we will never really have the guts to do what Bear Grylls does. This site is meant to be a humorous site full of terrible survival tips that clearly were conceived by someone who has never had to survive anywhere outside their mother’s basement. This will be accomplished by different pages teaching you “How to build a fire,” “How to build a shelter,” “How to find food!" The most interesting survival tips…that might not actually help anyone survive but will give a good laugh! We can even sell products (T-shirts, mugs, books, etc). Why not?</p>

                <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
                  <p>You would think that the target audience for a How to Survive in the Wild would be survival enthusiasts or outdoorsy types. I am definitely including them but seeing as how my site is going to be a comedic spoof on all things survival (Bear Grylls, Survivor Man, etc.), my target audience is anyone who appreciates a little humor. This could be people who work in an office setting and just have a quick 15 minute break and want to look at something other than Reddit (although reddit is great). Maybe along the way I can inspire those who ordinarily wouldn't go camping to realize that you don't have to be Bear Grylls to enjoy the outdoors. Specifically, I guess this could include people of all ages but probably younger adults would be most interested. All economic and social groups are invited! Men and Women. Whoever likes the outdoors.</p>

                <h3>Content List</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      "Will this site teach me?"
                      <ul>
                        <li>How To (information about different environments on each How To page)
                          <ul>
                            <li>Build a Fire: This page will explain in step-by-step detail what a person will need to build a fire. It will also go over materials needed (tinder, fire-starter like magnesium stick, etc). It will also cover what to do if your in the rain or high humidity. A video will be included of different methods of starting a fire.</li>
                            <li>Find Food: This page will show where smart places are to find food in the wild. It will show how to set traps and show pictures of the different kinds of animals that could get caught in those traps. It will include different kinds of vegetation that is OK to eat and some that are NOT ok to eat.</li>
                            <li>Find Water: This page will talk about how important it is to keep hydrated especially while performing physical labor and making fire and shelters. Methods for purifying water will be listed starting with the most basic (straining through a shirt or piece of cloth) to the most advanced (using some kind of filter). Good places to find water and bad places to find water will be shown in pictures.</li>
                            <li>Build a Shelter: This page will explain why a shelter is important and talk about what kind of shelter you want for how long you will be surviving. This page will also talk about the importance of using the materials around you (parts from a vehicle, or pieces of wreckage that may have had something to do with why you are stranded in the first place).</li>
                            <li>Get Found: This page will focus on where to go and what to look out for to eventually be found and make your way back to civilization.

                          </ul>
                        </li>

                            <li>Be an Expert Test (a test to get a certified expert diploma). This will be a small test that goes over some of the information in the How To pages. It will be a fun way for users of the site to see if they really have what it takes to survive in the wild.</li>
                            <li></li>
                          </ul>

                            <li>T-shirts, mugs, survival gear. (place to buy branded merchandise). This will be a cool way that people can support the site and show that they like the material covered. Shipping to the US only to start. Hopefully global shipping will become a possibility soon.</li>

                            <li>My Heroes (Bear Grylls Les Stroud, Mike Hawke etc.). This page will be a comedic shrine to all the survival show stars.

                          </ul>
                      </ul>

                        <li>Survival Rating</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Your survival rating (asks a series of questions and outputs a survival rating). This page will be a spoof of the survival rating that is given to participants of the show Naked and Afraid. It will ask a series of questions that will determine a Survival Rating at the end that people can share with their friends via email or Facebook.</li>
                          </ul>
                      </ul>

                <h3>Site Map</h3>
                  <img src="site_map_s.jpg" alt="site map">

                <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
                  <img src="color_scheme.jpg" alt="color scheme" height="100px">
                  <p>As for now, I would like to use the darker colors for the background and have the lighter hues be for text (the light yellow or the light blue). Links will be one of the blue colors. accents and logos can be some of the yellow and red hues. I want to use lighter grey colors as well. I am colorblind so I have to rely a lot of pallet generators and feedback from others.</p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                  <p class="impact_heading">Impact for Headings</p>
                  <p>This font called “Impact” would be great for headings because its has a heavier weight and will let users see important information quickly.</p>
                  <p class="menlo_links">Menlo for links</p>
                  <p>This font called “Menlo” would be great for links because it would look good in a deep blue color and underlined.</p>
                  <p class="optima_paragraphs">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut vitae dui consectetur, sollicitudin lacus ac, pellentesque orci. Pellentesque finibus placerat.</p>
                  <p>This font called Optima would be good for body paragraphs and the bulk of text on the site because it looks clean and easy to read.</p>

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                  <p>I want my navigation to be a bar along the top of every page that has my five basic links on it (How To, Survival Rating, Be an Expert, My Story, and Shop). I think it would be best to show these as an icon and have a very clean, simple, geometric shape of some sort that will be big enough to see clearly and will change border or shadow when hovered over. It will then drop down a menu to the pages under that icon</p>

                <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
